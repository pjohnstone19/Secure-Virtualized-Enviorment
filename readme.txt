How to Compile and Run:

	Install OpenSSL (if not already installed):
		sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

	Compile the project using g++:
		g++ main.cpp Authentication.cpp Sandbox.cpp IntrusionDetection.cpp Logger.cpp -o SecureEnvironment -lssl -lcrypto

	Run the program:
		./SecureEnvironment

Design and Implementation of a Secure Virtualized Environment with Intrusion Detection and Response in C++
*********************************************************************************************

Key Components and Implementation Details
	Secure User Authentication:

		* Use C++ to create a custom authentication system.
		* Store encrypted user credentials using a hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or bcrypt.
		* Implement multi-factor authentication by integrating OTP (One-Time Password) generation and verification.
		* Libraries/Tools: OpenSSL for hashing and cryptographic operations.

	Access Control and Sandboxing:

		* Implement process isolation using Linux namespaces, chroot, or cgroups via system calls.
		* Create a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in C++ that assigns roles to users and restricts operations based on permissions.
		* Example: Use system calls like setns() or libraries like libseccomp to enforce syscall restrictions for sandboxed processes.

	Encryption and Secure Communication:

		* Build a custom encryption mechanism for Inter-Process Communication (IPC).
		* Use C++ sockets for secure communication between processes and encrypt data using AES or RSA.
		* Implement a secure virtual file system (like eCryptfs) to store sensitive data.
		* Libraries/Tools: OpenSSL for encryption, std::filesystem for file handling.

	Intrusion Detection System (IDS):

		* Monitor system calls and process behavior using audit logs or hooks into the kernel.
		* Implement an anomaly detection system in C++ to flag suspicious activities:
		* Use basic rule-based matching (e.g., detecting unauthorized file access or privilege escalation).
		* Optionally integrate a simple machine learning model for anomaly detection.
	
	Tools:

		* ptrace or Linux Audit Framework for syscall monitoring.
		* Pattern matching or clustering algorithms in C++ STL or libraries like Eigen for anomaly detection.
		* Memory Protection and Randomization:

		* Implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) by modifying memory allocation behavior in your application.
		* Use C++ custom memory allocators to enhance protection against buffer overflows.
		- Example: Use std::allocator to create a secure memory allocator that randomizes block locations.

	Logging and Incident Response:

	  * Implement a detailed logging system using C++ file I/O for activities like:
		- User logins.
		- Detected anomalies.
		- Failed access attempts.
		- Automate responses like:
		- Killing suspicious processes using kill() syscall.
		- Notifying administrators via email or system alerts.
		- Libraries: Boost.Asio for network notifications, and std::fstream for log handling.

Project Architecture
*********************************************************************************************

	Core Modules:

		Authentication Module: Handles user credentials and multi-factor authentication.
		Access Control Module: Manages RBAC policies and sandboxing processes.
		Intrusion Detection Module: Monitors system calls and logs anomalies.
		Encryption Module: Secures file storage and IPC.
		Workflow:

		User logs in and gets authenticated via the Authentication Module.
		If authorized, user tasks are sandboxed and executed with access control checks.
		IDS continuously monitors system activity and logs potential threats.
		On detection, an automated response (e.g., alert or process termination) is triggered.

Deliverables: What are we giving him?
*********************************************************************************************

A fully functional C++ application demonstrating secure process management and intrusion detection.
Documentation explaining the architecture, key decisions, and how the system addresses both OS concepts and cybersecurity principles.
A demo video or presentation showcasing the application in action.
Challenges and How to Address Them
Low-Level System Calls: C++ gives direct access to system calls, but you must handle errors robustly.
Security Risks: Ensure sandboxing rules and encryption mechanisms are tested thoroughly.
Real-Time Monitoring: Efficient IDS implementation requires careful management of performance overhead.
